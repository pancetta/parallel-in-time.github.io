Bylaws for the parallel-in-time workshop series.

<!--more-->
With the aim to successfully continue the PinT workshop series even beyond the
[5th workshop](/events/upcoming/2016/5th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html) in Banff,
Canada, a set of [bylaws](/events/bylaws.html) for the election of a scientific committee has been
put in place during the workshop in [Dresden](/events/4th-pint-workshop/).
The bylaws define a set of rules for the election of a scientific committee.
The committee is responsible for the coordination and promotion of the workshop series.
We are looking forward to many more interesting PinT workshops!
