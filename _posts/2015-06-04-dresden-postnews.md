Successful 4th Workshop on Parallel-in-Time Integration in Dresden, Germany.

<!--more-->
The [4th PinT workshop](/events/4th-pint-workshop/) in
Dresden turned out to be another great event in the _Parallel-in-time integration_ workshop series:
With 40 participants from 9 different countries, this workshop again provided a lively forum for
many interesting discussions around a great many different aspects of PinT.
With several well-known researchers from the climate and atmospheric science community present,
fascinating discussions emerged about the feasibility of using parallel-in-time integration methods
in climate simulations and numerical weather prediction.

Moreover, in order to support the continuation of the workshop series,
[a set of bylaws](/events/bylaws.html) has been put in place and the first election of a scientific
committee will take place within four weeks after the workshop.

Certainly, everybody is now looking forward to the
[5th workshop](/events/5th-pint-workshop/) in the
series in November 2016 in Canada.
